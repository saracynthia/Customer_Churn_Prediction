# Customer_Chan_Prediction

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that. So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn, how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? What steps would you take to create a machine learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?

 
 **SOLUTION**

1. Prepare the data. This involves cleaning the data, removing any outliers, and converting the data into a format that can be used by the machine learning algorithm.
Split the data into training and test sets. The training set will be used to train the machine learning model, and the test set will be used to evaluate the model's performance.
2. Train the machine learning model. This involves feeding the training data to the algorithm and allowing it to learn the relationships between the different features and the target variable (churn).
3. Evaluate the machine learning model. This involves feeding the test data to the model and calculating the accuracy of the predictions.
4. Deploy the machine learning model. Once you are satisfied with the performance of the model, you can deploy it to production so that it can be used to predict customer churn in real time.
5. Once you have deployed the machine learning model, you can use it to identify customers who are at risk of churning. You can then target these customers with specific offers or promotions in an attempt to retain them.

By using machine learning to predict customer churn, Sprint can be proactive in preventing customers from leaving. This can save the company money and help to improve customer satisfaction.
